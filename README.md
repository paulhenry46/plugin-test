# PGP True E2E Plugin
> [!CAUTION]
> To get all features (local search, webauthn, export/import settings) you must use the version >=1.7.8 of bulwark mail.

End-to-end PGP for Bulwark Webmail, implemented as a **privileged** (same-origin) plugin. All cryptography runs locally in the browser — no key material ever leaves your device.

## Main Features

- **Core Cryptography** — Seamlessly encrypt, decrypt, sign, and verify emails locally using a modern OpenPGP engine. 
  - *Formats supported:* **PGP/MIME** (Read & Write) | **Inline-PGP** (Read-only, for legacy compatibility).
- **Zero-Disk Session Security (100% RAM)** — Unlike traditional plugins that temporarily write unlocked secret keys to shared browser storage (like IndexedDB), **PGP True E2E** isolates unlocked keys strictly within active plugin memory. Your decrypted keys never touch the disk, not even for a millisecond, ensuring instant destruction upon tab closure or browser crash.
- **True End-to-End Drafts & Attachments** — Standard PGP extensions only encrypt when you hit "Send", leaving your auto-saved drafts and attachments exposed to the mail server in cleartext while you write. This plugin intercepts the webmail's auto-save and upload cycles, encrypting drafts, attachments, and metadata (such as filename and MIME type) *locally in the browser* before they ever reach the network.
- **Encrypted-at-Rest Local Search Index** — **PGP True E2E** securely decrypts and indexes your emails into a local, encrypted-at-rest database. Search your secure history instantly without leaking a single keyword to the mail server or writing decrypted text to the disk.
- **Automated Key Exchange** — Automatically detects and imports public keys attached to incoming signed emails, making recipient keyring management effortless (optional).
- **Keyserver Integration** — Seamlessly publish your public key to or fetch recipient keys from `keys.openpgp.org` directly within the interface.
- **WebAuthn Passwordless Unlock** — Don't want to type your passphrase every time you open your webmail? Unlock your keys with a single click using WebAuthn/Passkeys (requires a hardware key/FIDO device supporting PRF).
- **Public Key Attachment** — One-click option to automatically attach your public key to outgoing emails.
- **Import / Export** — Easily backup and restore your local search/preview index and PGP keys.
- **Dynamic Recipient Badges:** Real-time check during drafting to see if `To/Cc/Bcc` addresses have valid public keys, displaying a visual badge next to them.
- **Smart Encryption Fallback:** If some recipients lack PGP keys, prompt the user before sending two separate emails with the same Message-ID (one encrypted to PGP-capable recipients, and one in cleartext to those without keys).

## Security & Threat Model

- **Privileged Tier:** The plugin declares `tier: "privileged"` + `crypto:full`. Per `resolvePluginTier`, the same-origin tier is only granted to a **signed, admin-approved (managed)** bundle after high-risk consent. Self-uploaded copies are refused (not downgraded)—it must be signed and shipped through the admin channel.
- **Keys at Rest:** Private keys are re-wrapped with AES-256-GCM under a PBKDF2 (SHA-256, 600,000 iterations) key derived from your custom passphrase. They are stored in IndexedDB; raw private key bytes are never persisted.
- **Keys in Use:** Unlocking a key stores it strictly in RAM. It is **never** persisted to IndexedDB or written to disk during the active session.
- **XSS & Isolation Limit:** The background part of the plugin acts like a service worker, communicating keys to other sandboxed components. 
  * *Note on Threat Model:* If an attacker successfully executes arbitrary JavaScript in the client (via XSS or a malicious third-party plugin), they could potentially intercept keys in memory. This is an inherent limitation of web-based cryptography. However, our 100% RAM isolation significantly reduces the attack surface compared to disk-bound alternatives that write active keys to browser storage.
- **Output Sanitization:** Returned HTML still passes through the host mail sanitizer before rendering.

## Roadmap (Planned Features)


- [x] **Address Book Integration:** Native integration of public keys within the Bulwark contact/address book. Available in next release (1.0.2)
- [ ] **Server vs. E2E Badges:** Display a dedicated badge in the email list row to distinguish between E2E encrypted emails and those encrypted server-side (requires a new hook and Stalwart Server modifications). If you want to get this feature, show your interest here : https://support.stalw.art/t/add-an-explicit-server-encryption-marker-header-for-at-rest-encrypted-messages/1139 because now, we can't know if the mail is E2E encrypted or just stored encrypted.
- [ ] Sync settings + keys accrois devices. Require new clients hook
- [ ] Generate your keys
- [ ] Check WKD of domains to search keys

## Build & Installation

```bash
npm install          # pulls pkijs / asn1js / pvtsutils / webcrypto-liner + esbuild
npm run build        # → dist/index.js (~1.7 MB, under the privileged cap)
npm run package      # → openpgp.zip (manifest.json + index.js) for admin upload
```

## Dependencies
We use
- OpenPGP, of course
- mimetext to generate the mime message when encrypting


## Thanks
This plugin is inspired by the official S/MIME plugin. Heartfelt thanks to its author, Linus Rath, for his invaluable work!
